			<h1>My Story</h1>
			<p>My career began in 2011 working in the energy industry as an internship student. 
			After graduating in 2012, I continued working in the energy industry for a few more years. 
			Looking to expand my professional horizon and a change in scenery, I opened my own business in 2014.
			<br>
			<br>Since launching my business, I spent a lot of time building it's website, learning HTML and CSS in the process.
			I realized I had already learned HTML and CSS, as well as other programming languages throughout my educational and professional career.
			I then built on what I already knew and started learning more and more languages out of curiosity and for fun.
			<br>
			<br>Unfortunately, my business didn't last very long. But through this failed endeavour, I was equipped with new found 
			knowledge regarding websites as well as search engine optimization. A few months later, I was back on my feet working
			at Treefrog as an SEO Engineer.
